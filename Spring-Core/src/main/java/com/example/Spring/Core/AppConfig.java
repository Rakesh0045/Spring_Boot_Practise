    | Question                                         | Answer                                                                          |
    | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Why is the `@Bean` method in `AppConfig` called? | Because Spring Boot uses `@ComponentScan`, which finds `@Configuration` classes |
    | Do I need to explicitly register `AppConfig`?    | **No**, as long as it's in the same package or subpackage as your main class    |
    | What if it's in a different package?             | Use `@ComponentScan(basePackages = "...")` to tell Spring where to look         |
